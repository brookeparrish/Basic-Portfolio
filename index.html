                    Hi! My name is Brooke Parrish and I am 28 years old.  I am originally from El Centro, California and currently reside in Tempe, Arizona.  I have a shih tzu named Hagrid, who I absolutely adore.  Unfortunately, he lives with my parents in Yuma, Arizona.  My hobbies include traveling to new places, going to concerts and dancing country swing.    
                </p>

                I have attended a few different Junior Colleges and received my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology from San Diego State.  I moved to Phoenix to work for the Department of Child Services but soon realized that field of work was not for me.  Currently, I work in the front office of a dental lab.  My duties include disinfecting, scheduling and invoicing cases.  I also provide excellent customer service to all of our dentists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although, I like what I currently do, I was introduced into web development and it really caught my eye.  I hope to get a lot out of this program and make a complete career change.
